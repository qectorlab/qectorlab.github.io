## Front matter

### How to read this book

This edition covers **the `qector-decoder-v3` Python package and its `qector` command-line
tool only**. The companion *Qector Decoder Workbench* graphical application (Windows/Linux)
has its own manual and is documented separately; it is **out of scope** here.

- **PART I** is the user manual: install, run, decode. Read this first.
- **PART II** is the package reference: every family, every module, every environment
  variable.
- **PART III** is the CLI reference: `qector decode`, `qector bench`, `qector serve`,
  `qector-doctor`.
- **PART IV** is the benchmarking guide: how to measure throughput and logical error
  rate on your own hardware, honestly and reproducibly (methodology only; this manual
  publishes no benchmark results).
- Appendices carry the wheel digests, history, license and citations.

Code blocks, tables and call-out notes are used consistently. **Honest-note** call-outs
mark statements that contradict typical marketing phrasing. They matter.

**Honesty and scope.** Decoder behaviour and accuracy depend on the machine they run on,
the exact check topology, the batch, the noise regime and the driver state. QECTOR ships
tools to measure this on your own hardware; no claim is made that any single number is
"ultimate".

# PART I: User Manual

## 1. Introduction and what is new in v1.0.0

QECTOR Decoder v3 is a production-grade, source-available quantum-error-correction
decoding platform: a compiled Rust core (PyO3) with a Python 3.9 to 3.13 surface. It decodes
syndromes from stabiliser/qLDPC circuits with 15+ decoder configurations, feeds
Stim/Sinter workflows, integrates with PyMatching and qiskit-qec, and can sit behind an
MCP server or a local CLI.

**v1.0.0 is the first stable release.** From this version the public API is governed by the
stability tiers of Part I section 8; bit-level compatibility is documented and an audit trail is
kept.

| What is new in 1.0.0 | Detail |
|---|---|
| First stable (v1) release | Semantic-versioning frozen; tiering of the API (Part I section 8) |
| Ecosystem entry points | Five Sinter decoders (`qector_blossom`, `qector_belief`, `qector_unionfind`, and more) and the qiskit-qec plugin are registered entry points; `sinter.collect(decoders=[...])` works without `custom_decoders=` |
| `pymatching` submodule shim | `from qector_decoder_v3.pymatching import Matching` |
| New decoder families | `AmbiguityClusterDecoder`, `TwoStageDecoder`, `ColourCodeDecoder` |
| Relay-BP | Layered serial BP schedule for qLDPC (`bp_method="relay"`); each check sees the freshest messages |
| CS-OSD(lambda, w) + LLR damping | Formal combination-sweep OSD in `bposd.py` with configurable `osd_lambda` and message `damping` |
| Weighted Union-Find on GPU | `CUDABatchDecoder` / `OpenCLBatchDecoder` accept `edge_weights`; both kernels agree |
| `CUDABatchDecoder(precision="f64")` | Double-precision weighted growth kernel for accuracy-critical workloads |
| `ColourCodeDecoder(method="cluster_bposd")` | Weighted UF growth over the undecomposed hypergraph DEM with spanning-tree peeling, then BP-OSD on residuals |
| `DemModel.make_decoder` | Covers all nine shipped native families from the DEM, with weights carried through |
| `qector` CLI + `qector-doctor` | `qector decode/serve` and a 15-check environment diagnostic |
| `SparseBlossomDecoder` zero-allocation | Hot path is now zero-allocation via thread-local `SbScratch` |
| Licence hardening | v2 tokens carry tier + expiry; malformed tokens return `False`; unreadable key files report *invalid* |
| Rust core crash safety | Six panic-to-abort paths removed (gRPC/CUDA mutex-poison propagation, swallowed CUDA async errors, `Bernoulli::new` unwrap, cascade-decoder `expect`) |
| `generate_parity_check_matrix()` | Now bound at module level for custom code construction |

## 2. System requirements

| Requirement | Supported | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Python | 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13 (CPython) | `requires-python >=3.9` |
| OS / wheels | Windows (win_amd64), Linux (manylinux_2_17 x86_64), macOS 11.0+ (arm64) | 15 binary wheels; **no sdist** |
| NumPy | `>=1.24.0,<2.3` | runtime dependency |
| Optional | CuPy (`pip install qector-decoder-v3[cuda,cupy]`) for batched GPU-resident BP; CUDA toolkit only for source builds | CUDA path ships **in** the wheel; OpenCL kernels must be built from source |
| RAM | 8 GiB recommended; batch sweeps scale with batch size | `decode_mmap` exists for out-of-core |
| Display | none | headless-safe in CLI and server modes |

**GPU note.** The standard wheel ships a working CUDA path (`CUDABatchDecoder`). On Windows
the NVIDIA driver is used in WDDM mode; compute servers using TCC typically see higher
performance. OpenCL kernels are **not compiled** into any wheel. `opencl_is_available()`
returns `False` everywhere, even where an OpenCL device exists. Use the source build if you
need OpenCL.

## 3. Installation

### 3.1 Standard install

```bash
python -m pip install "qector-decoder-v3==1.0.0"
```

All in-wheel decoders (Union-Find, Blossom, BP-OSD, BeliefMatching, and more) run on the CPU
core; no optional dependency is required.

### 3.2 Optional extras

The following optional extras are available for installation:

| Extra        | What it installs                                             | Needed for                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `cuda`       | CUDA runtime bindings                                        | NVIDIA GPU batch decode via `CUDABatchDecoder` |
| `cupy`       | CuPy                                                         | GPU-resident batched BP (`bp_cupy`) |
| `cupy-cuda12x` | CuPy CUDA 12-specific build                                 | CUDA 12-optimized GPU batch decoding |
| `stim`       | Stim, Sinter, PyMatching, LDPC ecosystem                      | Stim workflows and entry points   |
| `opencl`     | OpenCL bindings (wheel forbids kernels)                      | building from source with the OpenCL feature |
| `stripe`     | (payment) licence validation tooling                         | commercial tiers                   |
| `bench`      | Benchmark utilities                                          | honest benchmarking tools         |
| `pypy`       | PyPy-specific optimizations                                  | PyPy runtime optimizations         |
| `dev`        | Development tools (linting, testing)                         | contributors and package maintainers |
| `all`        | all of the above guide-only superset                        | convenience                        |

To install all optional features:

```bash
python -m pip install "qector-decoder-v3[all]==1.0.0"
```
### 3.3 Verifying what you downloaded (strong integrity)

Every wheel is published with **Trusted Publishing + Sigstore attestations**. Two checks
are recommended:

**SHA-256 (PyPI shows the digest):**

```bash
# at the PyPI page, the file digest is listed; verify on disk:
$ python -c "import hashlib; print(hashlib.sha256(open('qector_decoder_v3-1.0.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl','rb').read()).hexdigest())"
7f198c7d9ca8f28c461f907d2ec4f41464198446abc2239c894b550bce7d4f98   # cp311 win_amd64
```

**Sigstore (needs `cosign`):** verify the signature against the release tag:

```bash
cosign verify-blob --certificate ... --signature ... qector_decoder_v3-1.0.0-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
```

All 15 wheels SHA-256 digests are listed in Appendix B.

### 3.4 Source build (licensed / OpenCL)

Building from source requires the Rust toolchain (see the README). The `opencl` cargo
feature compiles the OpenCL batch kernels; the CPU and CUDA paths in the wheel are the
same decoding arithmetic as a source build.

### 3.5 First run

```bash
qector-doctor      # 15-check environment diagnostic; reports WHY a decoder is unavailable
qector decode --help
python -c "import qector_decoder_v3; print(qector_decoder_v3.__version__)"
```

The first import prints a licensing notice; set `QECTOR_SILENT=1` to suppress it.

## 4. Quick start (single-syndrome decode, batch, Stim DEM, CLI)

### 4.1 Single syndrome, Python

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import UnionFindDecoder, BlossomDecoder

checks = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]   # parity-check hyperedges
n_qubits = 4
syn = [1, 0, 1, 0]                          # must satisfy len(syn) == len(checks)

fast = UnionFindDecoder(checks, n_qubits)
mwpm = BlossomDecoder(checks, n_qubits)

print(fast.decode(syn))   # GF(2)-faithful correction (H @ corr == syndrome, mod 2)
print(mwpm.decode(syn))
```

### 4.2 Batch decode (CPU + CUDA)

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import BatchDecoder, CUDABatchDecoder

checks = [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]
n_qubits = 5
cpu  = BatchDecoder(checks, n_qubits)        # AVX2 path
gpu  = None
if CUDABatchDecoder.is_available():          # True on a CUDA device
    gpu = CUDABatchDecoder(checks, n_qubits)

syndromes = [[1,0,1,0,0], [0,1,0,1,0]]
print(cpu.parallel_batch_decode(syndromes))
if gpu is not None:
    print(gpu.batch_decode(syndromes))   # matches CPU, syndrome-faithful
```

> **Note.** Construct `CUDABatchDecoder` with both `check_to_qubits` **and** `n_qubits`;
  a missing argument raises rather than silently mis-firing.

### 4.3 Weighted GPU decode (accuracy path)

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import dem, CUDABatchDecoder

model = dem.from_stim(circuit.detector_error_model(decompose_errors=True))
graph = model.collapse_to_graph()

gpu = CUDABatchDecoder(
    graph.check_to_qubits(),
    graph.num_errors,
    graph.weights().tolist(),   # log((1-p)/p) per mechanism
)
```

**Honest note:** Without `edge_weights` the GPU kernels run unweighted cluster growth, which
cannot distinguish a $p = 10^{-4}$ mechanism from a $p = 10^{-2}$ one; on circuit-level noise that
costs several times the logical error rate. The `precision="f64"` option gives
double-precision weighted growth for accuracy-critical workloads.

### 4.4 Stim DEM workflow

```python
import stim
from qector_decoder_v3 import BlossomDecoder, DemModel

circuit = stim.Circuit.generated(
    "repetition_code:memory", distance=5, rounds=3,
    before_round_data_depolarization=0.01
)
dem = circuit.detector_error_model(add_detectors_for_gate_errors=True)
model = DemModel.from_stim(dem)
decoder = model.make_decoder("blossom")      # or "union_find", "bposd", ...
sampler = circuit.compile_detector_sampler()
syndromes, observables = sampler.sample(shots=1000, separate_observables=True)
for s in syndromes:
    corr = decoder.decode(s)
```

### 4.5 Automatic decoder recommendation

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import recommend_decoder
print(recommend_decoder(code_family="surface", distance=5, priority="accuracy"))
# BlossomDecoder
```

Workload-sensitive: regeneration per code/hardware/batch, see Part II section 3.

### 4.6 CLI

```bash
qector decode  --dem model.dem --syndrome "0,1,0,1"
qector serve   --port 8080                                   # local REST boundary
qector-doctor                                                # 15-check diagnostic
```

Full CLI reference in Part III.

## 5. Decoder catalogue

> **Faithfulness invariant.** Every decoder in every tier returns GF(2)-faithful
> corrections: the accepted correction `c` always satisfies `H @ c == syndrome (mod 2)`.
> Families that violate this for a code raise a clear error, never a silent wrong result.

| Decoder / entry | Best use | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| `UnionFindDecoder` (aliases `UF`, `union_find`) | Low-latency approximate decode | Stable |
| `FastUnionFindDecoder` | Optimized Union-Find hot path | Stable |
| `BlossomDecoder` | Exact MWPM; runs PyMatching-parity validation | Stable |
| `SparseBlossomDecoder` | Faster near-optimal matching (zero-allocation hot path in v1.0.0) | Experimental |
| `BatchDecoder` / `CPUBatchDecoder` | CPU batch Monte-Carlo sweeps (AVX2) | Stable |
| `CUDABatchDecoder` | Optional CUDA batch decode, `edge_weights`, `precision="f64"`, output == CPU batch result | Workload-sensitive (runtime dependent) |
| `CUDABpOsdDecoder` | CUDA BP-OSD batch decode | Build/runtime dependent |
| `OpenCLBatchDecoder` | OpenCL batch decode (`edge_weights`) | Build dependent (not in wheels) |
| `SpaceTimeDecoder` | 3D space-time (multi-round) decoding | Experimental |
| `BpOsdDecoder` / `BPOSDDecoder` | LDPC / qLDPC decoding, Relay-BP schedules, CS-OSD, LLR damping | Experimental |
| `BeliefMatching` | Correlated-noise accuracy mode | Workload-sensitive |
| `LookupTableDecoder` | Tiny codes, O(1) table lookup | Stable |
| `PredecodedDecoder` | Easy-syndrome prefiltering | Experimental |
| `AutoDecoder` / `AutoRouterPolicy` | Routes to a concrete decoder by analysis | Workload-sensitive |
| `HybridDecoder` | GNN pre-decoder + sparse blossom | Experimental |
| `DecoderPool` / `get_decoder` / `decode_mmap` | Scale-out batch, cached factory, out-of-core | Stable |
| `Workbench` | High-level multi-decoder orchestration (Python) | Stable |
| `SlidingWindowDecoder` / `StreamingDecoder` | Multi-round streaming workflows | Experimental |
| `NeuralPredecoder` / `GNNPredecoder` / `GNNTrainer` | Learned predecoder front-ends | Research |
| `AmbiguityClusterDecoder` | BP + |LLR| partition + exact per-cluster enumeration | Experimental |
| `TwoStageDecoder` | Decoupled X and Z sector matching | Experimental |
| `ColourCodeDecoder` | BP-OSD over the *undecomposed* colour-code hypergraph; opt-in `method="cluster_bposd"` | Experimental |
| `LERBenchmark` | Logical error rate evaluation with Wilson CI | Experimental |

**Honest notes**
- Union-Find is a fast approximate path (higher LER than exact MWPM), best as triage or a
  performance lever.
- `BlossomDecoder` is weight-optimal exact MWPM; it reaches PyMatching accuracy but is
  **not faster**.
- `SparseBlossom` is region-growing *near-optimal*, not exact. In v1.0.0 its hot path is
  zero-allocation via thread-local `SbScratch`.
- `BpOsdDecoder` is a self-contained BP-OSD for arbitrary GF(2) check matrices, always
  syndrome-faithful. v1.0.0 adds Relay-BP (`bp_method="relay"`), CS-OSD with configurable
  `osd_lambda`, and LLR message `damping`.
- `CUDABatchDecoder` output is bit-identical to the CPU batch result and syndrome-faithful.
  The `precision="f64"` option gives double-precision weighted growth.
- `OpenCLBatchDecoder` reports unavailable in the standard wheels (no kernels compiled);
  enable it with a source build.
- `ColourCodeDecoder` default method is `bposd` (plain BP-OSD). The opt-in
  `method="cluster_bposd"` uses weighted UF growth with spanning-tree peeling, then
  BP-OSD on residuals.

## 6. The Python layer

All additive modules are NumPy+stdlib-first and degrade cleanly when CuPy is absent.
`import qector_decoder_v3` can never break on a CPU-only box.

The Python layer is **additive, not required**. Every public symbol at the top
level (decoders, routing, `DemModel`, license API, `ler`, `run_mcp_server`,
`__version__`, the `dem` submodule alias) is re-exported from
`qector_decoder_v3/__init__.py` and works without any of the optional
extras being installed. Optional features are gated behind importable
submodules so `import qector_decoder_v3.bposd` or `import qector_decoder_v3.predecoder`
is the only place a missing dependency can surface, and a missing `cupy` or
`stim` import is reported cleanly through `hasattr` probes, not as an `ImportError`
at top-level import time. The CPU decode path and the stable table below are
always available on every wheel.

**Top-level surface** (importable directly from `qector_decoder_v3`):

| Symbol | Notes |
|---|---|
| `UnionFindDecoder`, `BlossomDecoder`, `SparseBlossomDecoder` | low-latency, exact-MWPM, near-optimal sparse hot path |
| `BatchDecoder`, `CUDABatchDecoder` | CPU AVX2 batch and optional CUDA batch |
| `DemModel`, `recommend_decoder` | DEM-driven construction and routing (Section 4.4) |
| `ColourCodeDecoder` | colour-code hypergraph decoder |
| `set_license_key`, `set_license_key_file`, `get_license_info`, `verify_license_token` | license API (Part II section 10) |
| `ler` | LER measurement module (Part IV section 3) |
| `dem` | submodule alias for `DemModel` and DEM helpers |
| `run_mcp_server` | MCP server entry point (Part II section 7) |
| `__version__` | dunder; string form of the package version |

**Pattern.** Most code only needs the top-level surface. Reach into a submodule
(`qector_decoder_v3.bposd`, `.codes`, `.rest_api`, ...) when you want a feature
that is not stable, not always available, or that is intentionally out of the
default import path.

| Module | Purpose | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| `gpu_backend` | One policy-aware GPU capability foundation (`has_cupy`, `has_cuda_rust`, `gpu_available`, `get_backend`, `get_array_module`) | Stable |
| `bp_cupy` | GPU-resident batched belief propagation (`BatchedBpDecoder`, `batched_bp_decode`); the NumPy path is bit-identical for a single shot | Workload-sensitive |
| `dem` | Detector-error-model surface (`DemModel.from_stim`, `collapse_to_graph`, `make_decoder`) carrying edge weights into every decoder | Stable |
| `routing` | Decoder selection (`recommend_decoder`, `AutoRouter`) inspecting the actual check structure; routes hyperedge/qLDPC to BP-OSD | Stable |
| `streaming` | Dependency-free multi-round orchestration (`StreamingSession`, `sliding_window_decode`) in the phenomenological perfect-measurement regime | Experimental |
| `autodebug` | Self-debugging layer behind AutoDecoder (`probe_decoders`, `resilient_single_decode`, `run_self_diagnostics`) | Stable |
| `scale-out` | `DecoderPool` (multi-process, auto-Rayon fallback on Windows), `get_decoder` cached factory, `decode_mmap` out-of-core, `Workbench` orchestrator | Stable |
| `bposd` | BP-OSD with Relay-BP, CS-OSD(lambda, w), LLR damping | Workload-sensitive |
| `belief_matching` | `BeliefMatching.from_numpy_h` faithful length-n_qubits output | Workload-sensitive |
| `predecoder` | `PredecodedDecoder`, `NeuralPredecoder`, `GNNPredecoder`, `GNNTrainer` | Experimental (GNN/Neural: Research) |
| `codes` | Code generators: repetition, ring, surface, toric, heavy_hex, bicycle, bivariate_bicycle, color_code, hypergraph_product | Stable |
| `stim_compat` | `from_stim_detector_error_model`, `stim_decoder_from_dem` | Workload-sensitive |
| `sinter_compat` | `qector_sinter_decoders()` with entry points registered | Workload-sensitive |
| `pymatching` / `pymatching_compat` | `Matching` drop-in shim (submodule and attribute spelling) | Workload-sensitive |
| `qiskit_plugin` | qiskit-qec entry point (registered in v1.0.0) | Workload-sensitive |
| `rest_api` | Local FastAPI decoding service (127.0.0.1 only) | Experimental |
| `license` | `verify_license_token`, `set_license_key`, `set_license_key_file`, `get_license_info` | Stable |
| `ler` | LER measurement (`estimate_ler`, `estimate_ler_circuit_level`, `assert_comparable`, `wilson_ci`, `run_threshold_sweep`, `run_memory_experiment`, `run_competitive_suite`); see Part IV section 3 | Stable |

**Usage pattern** (top-level only, CPU, no optional deps):

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import (
    UnionFindDecoder, BlossomDecoder,     # decoders
    DemModel, recommend_decoder,           # DEM + routing
    run_mcp_server, get_license_info,      # service surface
)
import qector_decoder_v3 as qv             # __version__ lives here
print(qv.__version__)
```

Tier definitions are in section 8 below; this table maps each module to its
tier so the developer can decide whether the API is something to depend on.
## 7. Stim / Sinter / PyMatching / qiskit-qec

| Hook | API | Reference toolchain |
|---|---|---|
| Stim | `stim_compat`: `from_stim_detector_error_model`, `stim_decoder_from_dem` | Stim v1.16.0 |
| Sinter | `sinter_compat`: `qector_sinter_decoders()` provides `qector_blossom`, `qector_belief`, `qector_unionfind`, and more; **entry points registered**, so `sinter.collect(decoders=["qector_blossom", ...])` needs no `custom_decoders=` | Sinter |
| PyMatching shim | `from qector_decoder_v3.pymatching_compat import Matching` and the submodule spelling `from qector_decoder_v3.pymatching import Matching`; backed by the QECTOR blossom decoder | PyMatching v2.4.0 |
| qiskit-qec | the `qiskit_plugin` entry point (registered in v1.0.0) | Qiskit |

```python
import sinter
results = sinter.collect(
    decoders=["qector_blossom", "qector_unionfind"],
    circuit=circuit, shots=1000
)
```

## 8. API stability tiers

| Tier | Meaning | Members (representative) |
|---|---|---|
| **Stable** | Usable across 1.x; bug-fix changes only | Core decoders, code generators, `DecoderPool`, `get_decoder`, `decode_mmap`, `Workbench`, `dem.make_decoder`, source build |
| **Workload-sensitive** | Valid, but claims must be regenerated per code/hardware/batch | BeliefMatching, BP-OSD, AutoDecoder/AutoRouter, CUDA batch, Stim/Sinter/PyMatching helpers |
| **Experimental / preview** | REST/gRPC/MCP services, metrics exporter, hybrid, two-stage, ambiguity-cluster, colour-code, GNN/neural predecoders, hosted API, OEM embedding, OpenCL batch | Deployment or build review required |
| **Internal detail** | Native core internals and fallback heuristics; may change without notice | Rust-core heuristics |

## 9. GPU, CuPy and OpenCL: honest capability matrix

| Compute path | In standard wheel? | Probe | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU decoders | Always | N/A | Always available |
| CUDA `CUDABatchDecoder` | Yes (CUDA core) | `has_cuda_rust()`, `cuda_is_available()` | Available on a CUDA device; output matches the CPU batch result; optional `edge_weights`; optional `precision="f64"` |
| CUDA-BP `CUDABpOsdDecoder` | Build-dependent | `cuda_is_available()` | CUDA builds only; single-shot convenience via `.decode()` |
| CuPy `bp_cupy` | Optional (`pip install cupy`) | `has_cupy()`, `gpu_available()` | Device present + CuPy |
| OpenCL `OpenCLBatchDecoder` | **No** (no kernels) | `opencl_is_available()` | `False` even with an OpenCL device; source build required |

You lose nothing on the standard wheel: the CPU and CUDA paths do the same decoding, and the
CUDA path is correctness-verified against the CPU batch result.

## 10. REST / local service and security boundary

Together with the MCP server (Part II section 7), a local REST service is provided by
`qector serve` (Part III section 3). All such surfaces share the same security boundary:

- Bind to `127.0.0.1` only, by default, and never expose it directly to the public
  internet (no TLS termination, no coarse input throttling, no authN/authZ layer).
- Validate every request: syndrome lengths, decoder families, content length (10 MB cap).
  Malformed JSON-RPC/REST calls return an error object, never a crash.
- Treat the local service as **experimental / preview** tier: for local, single-user,
  controlled use and prototyping. For SaaS/hosted deployment you must consult the
  licensing terms first (commercial licence required, see section 11) and add your own
  termination, rate limiting, and authentication around it.

## 11. Licensing and citation

The software is **source-available under the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0**: free
for personal, academic, educational and non-commercial research; **commercial use, funded
institutional work, SaaS/hosted API deployment, OEM integration or paid consulting requires
a commercial licence** (https://qector.store/pricing, admin@qector.store).

# PART II: Extended Reference (package API)

## 1. Core architecture

Rust extension (PyO3), Python 3.9 to 3.13 surface. The Python layer is a thin but essential
tier: layout, routing, scale-out, batch plumbing and the `dem` weight carrier. The Rust
core owns decoding (Blossom, Union-Find, BP, OSD, cascade), the licence kernel (Ed25519)
and the batch kernels (CPU AVX2, CUDA).

## 2. Decoder families (package API)

Families are available under short names (`blossom`, `blossom_bp`, ...) and long class names
(`BlossomDecoder`, ...) as listed in the catalogue in Part I section 5. Constructors follow the pattern:

```python
BlossomDecoder(checks_or_H, n_qubits=None, ...)
UnionFindDecoder(checks_or_H, n_qubits=None, ...)
BpOsdDecoder(H, error_rate=0.05, osd_order=0, bp_method="exact",
             damping=0.0, osd_lambda=24, ...)          # arbitrary GF(2) matrices
```

For circuit DEM-driven construction the preferred path is `DemModel.make_decoder(family)`
(section 3).

### BP-OSD options (v1.0.0)

| Option | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `bp_method` | `"exact"` | `"exact"` (log-domain sum-product), `"min_sum"`, or `"relay"` (layered serial) |
| `osd_order` | `0` | `0`, `1`, or `2` for combination-sweep OSD |
| `osd_lambda` | `24` | Number of free bits closest to the reliability cut-off for CS-OSD |
| `damping` | `0.0` | LLR message damping: `m = (1-d)*m_new + d*m_old` on `min_sum`/`sum_product` |

## 3. Routing and `DemModel`

- `from qector_decoder_v3.dem import DemModel` with `from_stim` / `from_parities` /
  `make_decoder`, carrying edge weights through to every decoder; `make_decoder` covers all
  nine shipped native families.
- `DemModel.DECODER_KINDS` enumerates all constructible families.
- `recommend_decoder(code_family, distance, priority)` inspects the actual check
  structure; hyperedge/qLDPC is routed to BP-OSD, surface-type to Blossom/UF.
- `generate_parity_check_matrix()` is bound at module level for custom code construction.

## 4. AutoDecoder: 7-tier fallback

Behind `AutoDecoder`/`AutoRouter`, `autodebug` probes candidate decoder families against
your check structure and, on each decode error, walks the 7 tiers in a deterministic
order (probe, single, cascade, legacy, ...), always landing on a family that can
return a faithful correction or a clear error. `run_self_diagnostics()` gives a full
report.

| Tier | Backend | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | CUDA Batch | GPU batch decoding via NVRTC-compiled kernels |
| 2 | OpenCL Batch | Cross-vendor GPU batch decoding |
| 3 | CPU Rayon | Multi-threaded parallel CPU batch decoding |
| 4 | CPU Batch | Single-threaded CPU batch decoding |
| 5 | CPU Single | Per-syndrome CPU decoding |
| 6 | Blossom | Exact MWPM fallback (guaranteed correctness) |
| 7 | Lookup Table / Python | Pure-Python last-resort fallback |

Key features:
- **Automatic error trapping**: Hardware exceptions (CUDA OOM, driver crashes, memory limits) are caught, logged, and bypassed transparently.
- **Health scoring**: Each backend tracks its health status. Failed backends are automatically suspended.
- **Seamless recovery**: `reset_backend_health()` re-enables all backends for dynamic recovery.
- **Diagnostic logging**: All fallback events and error details are recorded for debugging.

## 5. Code generators

The code-generator module builds repetition, surface, ring, colour-code, bicycle,
bivariate-bicycle, hypergraph-product, heavy-hex, and toric lattices for
quick experiments. Exact listing is in the API docs of the installed wheel
(`help(qector_decoder_v3)` beats a printed book); the generators are Stable tier.

## 6. Minimal usage examples

```python
# Example: DEM-driven construction with routing
from qector_decoder_v3 import DemModel, recommend_decoder

dem = DemModel.from_parities(checks, n_qubits, edge_weights={...})  # weights carried
decoder = dem.make_decoder("blossom")          # or "union_find", "bposd", ...
print(recommend_decoder(code_family="surface", distance=5, priority="accuracy"))

# Example: BP-OSD with Relay-BP and CS-OSD
from qector_decoder_v3.bposd import BpOsdDecoder
decoder = BpOsdDecoder(H, error_rate=0.05, bp_method="relay",
                        osd_order=1, osd_lambda=24, damping=0.1)

# Example: Colour-code with cluster_bposd
from qector_decoder_v3 import ColourCodeDecoder
decoder = ColourCodeDecoder(checks, method="cluster_bposd")
```

Use the code blocks of Part I section 4 verbatim as your templates: single, batch, DEM, routing.

## 7. Package MCP server (`run_mcp_server`)

Every wheel ships the MCP server (JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio), no extra feature flag, no
install:

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import run_mcp_server
run_mcp_server()
```

```bash
python -c "import qector_decoder_v3; qector_decoder_v3.run_mcp_server()"
```

A ready-made client configuration lives in `mcp.json`. The server advertises 13 tools, all
verified against the released wheel:

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `decode_syndrome` | Decode a syndrome with any decoder family (Union-Find, Blossom, SparseBlossom, BP-OSD, Cascade, Hybrid, ...) |
| `batch_decode` | Batch-decode multiple syndromes in parallel |
| `decode_hyperedge` | Hyperedge / qLDPC decoding (bypasses the graph-only UF restriction) |
| `decode_syndrome_blossom` | Exact Blossom (MWPM) single decode |
| `batch_decode_blossom` | Exact Blossom (MWPM) batch decode |
| `decode_syndrome_cascade` | Hybrid cascading decoder (UF pre-filter escalating to Blossom) |
| `benchmark_decoder` | Run a performance benchmark for a decoder family |
| `run_ler_benchmark` | Run the LER (logical error rate) benchmark across code distances |
| `get_decoder_info` | Decoder configuration, version info, family listing |
| `get_backend_health` | Backend health across the 7 fallback tiers |
| `clear_decoder_cache` | Clear the decoder factory cache |
| `get_server_env` | Effective QECTOR environment variables |
| `recommend_decoder` | Decoder recommendation by code topology and priority |

The stdio reader enforces a 10 MB content limit and validates syndrome lengths and
decoder types, returning JSON-RPC errors instead of crashing. Scope: local/controlled
use; **not** hardened for public SaaS exposure (see Part I section 10).

## 8. Hyperedge decoding

Graphlike Union-Find rejects high-degree incidence matrices; use the explicit hyperedge
path:

```python
import numpy as np
from qector_decoder_v3 import BlossomDecoder, SparseBlossomDecoder, BpOsdDecoder

def decode_hyperedge(checks, n_qubits, syndrome, kind="Blossom", **opts):
    syn = np.asarray(syndrome, dtype=np.uint8).ravel()
    if kind.lower() in ("blossom",):
        return BlossomDecoder(checks, n_qubits).decode(syn)
    if kind.lower() in ("sparse_blossom", "sparseblossom"):
        return SparseBlossomDecoder(checks, n_qubits).decode(syn)
    if kind.lower() in ("bposd", "bp_osd"):
        H = np.zeros((len(checks), n_qubits), dtype=np.uint8)
        for i, c in enumerate(checks):
            for q in c:
                if 0 <= q < n_qubits:
                    H[i, q] ^= 1
        return BpOsdDecoder(H, error_rate=opts.get("error_rate", 0.05),
                            osd_order=opts.get("osd_order", 0)).decode(syn)
    raise ValueError(f"unsupported kind: {kind}")
```

**MCP + fallback pattern**: try the package MCP `decode_hyperedge` tool, or
`BlossomDecoder`/`BpOsdDecoder` directly (in-wheel, always available).

## 9. Environment variables (tuning reference)

| Variable | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `QECTOR_LICENSE` | (unset) | Ed25519 token (overrides key file) |
| `QECTOR_LICENSE_KEY` | (unset) | inline licence key; resolved before the file-based keys |
| `QECTOR_LICENSE_FILE` | `~/.qector/license.key` | path to a licence key file; an unreadable file is *invalid*, never a silent downgrade |
| `QECTOR_SILENT` | (unset) | `1` suppresses the startup licensing notice |
| `QECTOR_ENFORCE` | (unset) | `1` enables hard license gating (rejects decode on invalid/expired) |
| `QECTOR_CUDA_DEVICE_ID` | `0` | CUDA device index for the native kernels |
| `QECTOR_OPENCL_DEVICE_ALLOW` | (unset) | comma-separated device-name substrings (source builds/OpenCL only) |
| `QECTOR_BLOSSOM_K_MULT` | `2.0` | candidate-neighbour multiplier (changes matching quality) |
| `QECTOR_BLOSSOM_INTRA_PAR` | `auto` | intra-decode parallelism for blossom (performance) |
| `QECTOR_BLOSSOM_INTRA_THREADS` | (unset) | dedicated Rayon pool size for the blossom hot path |
| `QECTOR_DATA_DIR` | per-user | relocate `logs`, `exports`, `settings` of the CLI/service |
| `QECTOR_DISABLE_OPENCL` | (unset) | `1` skips OpenCL probing |

Only `QECTOR_BLOSSOM_K_MULT` (and `QECTOR_OPENCL_DEVICE_ALLOW`, where kernels exist) change
matching quality; the rest are performance or hygiene knobs.

## 10. Licensing API and key resolution

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import set_license_key, set_license_key_file, get_license_info
set_license_key(token)                     # programmatic; raises ValueError if rejected
set_license_key_file("/path/to/key")       # or file
info = get_license_info()
print(info["tier"], info["key_status"])   # e.g. ('enterprise', 'valid')
```

The core resolves a key on its own in this order: `QECTOR_LICENSE_KEY` then `QECTOR_LICENSE_FILE`
then `~/.qector/license.key`. Prefer a file in deployments. The key then never lands in a
process listing or shell history. Check `key_status == "valid"` **and** the tier, never
just the tier: a set-but-unreadable `QECTOR_LICENSE_FILE` is reported as *invalid*, not as
a silent Community fallback. Offline verification: `verify_license_token` (Ed25519).
Malformed tokens return `False`; they never raise.

v2 tokens carry `tier` and `exp` (expiry) inside the Ed25519 signature. Use
`license_claims()` to access verified, unexpired claims.

## 11. What this package is not

- **Not** a circuit simulation engine (bring your samples: Stim, sinter, your own).
- **Not** a GUI. The Workbench app is covered by its own manual.
- **Not** a SaaS-ready REST/gRPC server. The rest/gRPC/MCP surfaces are designed for local
  controlled use and experimental deployments only.
- **Not** a security product for untrusted inputs at Internet scale.

# PART III: CLI Reference

## 1. `qector decode`

Decode one syndrome or a DEM file.

```bash
qector decode --dem model.dem --syndrome "0,1,0,1"
qector decode --checks "0,1:0,2:1,2" --qubits 4 --syndrome "1,0,1,0" --decoder blossom
```

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--dem <file>` | detector-error-model file (Stim DEM JSON or text) |
| `--checks`, `--qubits` | inline check hyperedges + qubit count |
| `--syndrome` | comma-separated `0/1` syndrome; length must equal the check count |
| `--decoder` | family (`union_find`, `fast_union_find`, `blossom`, `sparseblossom`, `bposd`, `cascade`, `auto`); default `auto` |
| `--json` | machine-readable output (correction, weight, backend) |
| `--seed` | determinism seed |

Exit code `0` = faithful correction produced, `2` = license/tier gating, `3` = malformed
input, `4` = decoder unavailable (see `qector-doctor` for *why*).

## 2. `qector bench`

Quick throughput measurement on a generated rotated surface-code circuit. The circuit is
built in-memory from Stim with the requested distance, rounds and physical noise, then
`shots` are decoded with the chosen family. The command prints a single honest rate line
(e.g. `shots/s` for the given machine state); no claim is attached to it.

```bash
qector bench --distance 5 --rounds 5 --shots 10000 --decoder blossom --noise 0.001
qector bench -d 7 -r 5 -s 100000 -d blossom -n 0.001
```

| Flag | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `--distance` / `-d` | `5` | surface-code distance |
| `--rounds` / `-r` | `5` | syndrome-extraction rounds |
| `--shots` / `-s` | `10,000` | number of shots to decode |
| `--decoder` | `blossom` | decoder family (see `qector decode --help`) |
| `--noise` / `-n` | `0.001` | per-gate physical error probability used by the generated circuit |

Use the same `--noise` for any two runs you intend to compare. Results are
machine-, driver- and power-state-conditional; see Part IV section 1.

## 3. `qector serve`

Local REST service (127.0.0.1 only by default).

```bash
qector serve --port 8080
```

Endpoints: `POST /decode`, `POST /batch`, `GET /health`, `GET /env`,
`GET|POST /recommend`. TLS/CORS header checks are **not** enforced; keep it local.

## 4. `qector-doctor`: 15-check environment diagnostic

Reports, per check, `PASS` / `WARN` / `FAIL`, plus an explanation. Answers *why* a decoder
is unavailable instead of failing at decode time. The full set is self-documenting via
`qector-doctor --json`. Representative checks:

1. Python version (3.9 to 3.13)
2. `qector_decoder_v3` importable, version == 1.0.0
3. wheel digests vs PyPI (optional `--check-hashes`)
4. NumPy bounds (`>=1.24.0,<2.3`)
5. licence resolution state (env/key/file), `key_status == "valid"` per tier
6. CPU core decoder availability (always PASS)
7. AVX2 batch path available
8. CUDA device probe (`cuda_is_available()`); WDDM vs TCC note
9. CUDA batch decode vs CPU batch equality on one synthetic shot
10. CuPy present / `gpu_available()`
11. OpenCL probe (`False` on wheels; documented)
12. stim import + DEM conversion works
13. sinter entry points resolvable
14. MCP server cold-start + `get_decoder_info` round-trip
15. write access to `QECTOR_DATA_DIR` (managed locations)

Exit `0` when all checks PASS; `1` on any FAIL/WARN; JSON report via `--json`.

# PART IV: How to benchmark (methodology)

This part is a **methodology guide only**. It tells you how to measure decoding
throughput and logical error rate on your own hardware with the tools the wheel ships.
This manual publishes **no benchmark results**: every number you produce is
system-specific and must be labelled as such (Part IV section 5).

## 1. Principles: honest, reproducible, system-specific

Before any measurement, agree with yourself (and your collaborators) on the following:

- **Throughput is not a property of the decoder alone.** It depends on the CPU model
  and microcode, RAM bandwidth, GPU model and driver stack (WDDM vs TCC), the OS
  scheduler, power management (turbo, DVFS), batch size, code family, distance and
  noise level. A number you measure on your laptop is a property of *that laptop at
  that moment*, not of the software.
- **Always fix the noise model.** Compare runs at the same physical error probability
  (e.g. `--noise 0.001`) and, for LER work, the same noise model. The `ler` module
  enforces this: `ler.assert_comparable(results)` returns the shared noise model or
  raises `NoiseModelMismatch` when rows mix models. Use it before any comparison.
- **Use deterministic seeds.** Every tool in this part accepts a `seed`. Keep it in the
  output. Seedless runs are not reproducible and not comparable.
- **Record the environment.** Machine model, CPU/GPU, driver version, OS, Python
  version, package version, seed, date, power mode. Without this, a result is
  uninterpretable.
- **Never subtract baselines you did not measure on the same box.** "X is N times
  faster than Y" is only meaningful when X and Y ran on the same hardware, same batch,
  same noise, same shot count, same process state.

## 2. Throughput via `qector bench` (CLI)

The CLI measures end-to-end decode throughput on a generated rotated surface-code
circuit (Stim in-memory, no files required):

```bash
qector bench --distance 5 --rounds 5 --shots 10000 --decoder blossom --noise 0.001
```

Step-by-step:

1. Pick the code size (`--distance`) and rounds (`--rounds`) that match your target
   workload.
2. Set `--noise` to the physical error rate of your noise model. Keep it constant
   across the runs you will compare.
3. Choose `--shots` so the run lasts seconds, not milliseconds (for example 10,000 for
   a quick check, 100,000+ for a steadier figure). Short runs are dominated by
   construction and JIT/OS noise.
4. Repeat the same command 3 times and report the median, never the best run.
5. Record the machine state (turbo on/off, AC power, background load) in your notes.

The printed line (e.g. `shots/s` for the chosen family, distance and rounds) is a
throughput estimate for that exact configuration. To compare families, change only
`--decoder` and keep everything else identical.

## 3. LER via the Python `ler` module

Logical error rate is the accuracy metric: the fraction of shots whose decoded
correction fails against the code's logical observables. Use the `ler` module directly
from Python:

```python
from qector_decoder_v3 import ler

# Code-capacity LER at one physical rate (i.i.d. bit-flip noise)
res = ler.estimate_ler(code, decoder, p=0.01, shots=100_000, seed=0)

# Circuit-level LER on a rotated surface code (gate/reset/measure noise)
res = ler.estimate_ler_circuit_level(
    distance=5, decoder="blossom", p=0.001, shots=100_000, rounds=5,
    seed=0, basis="x",
)

# Wilson 95% confidence interval for a binomial proportion
lo, hi = ler.wilson_ci(res.errors, res.shots)

# Enforce a single noise model before comparing any rows
shared = ler.assert_comparable([res1, res2])   # raises on mixture
```

Key facts:

- `estimate_ler` samples i.i.d. bit-flip errors, decodes in one warm batched decoder
  instance, and counts a logical failure whenever the residual `correction XOR error`
  carries logical content (code-observable matrix, E1/C6 criterion).
- Unfaithful corrections (those that do not reproduce the syndrome) are counted
  separately in `LerResult.unfaithful`, never silently folded into the LER. Zero
  unfaithful is the quality gate.
- `estimate_ler_circuit_level` is the measurement the QEC field benchmarks under and
  the one to use for **any cross-decoder comparison**: it samples detectors from a real
  Stim circuit with gate, reset and measurement noise over `rounds` rounds, and scores
  against the circuit's own logical observables.
- `run_threshold_sweep(code_factory, distances, p_values, decoder, shots, seed)` runs
  an LER-vs-p sweep per distance and reports the crossing where larger distance stops
  strictly lowering the LER (the threshold signature). `run_memory_experiment`,
  `run_competitive_suite` and `reference_validate` are available for full studies.
- `LerResult` fields: `decoder`, `code`, `physical_error_rate`, `shots`, `errors`,
  `unfaithful`, `seconds`, `seed`, `n_logical_qubits`, `noise_model`, `rounds`.

## 4. MCP benchmark procedure (`benchmark_decoder`, `run_ler_benchmark`)

The package MCP server (Part II section 7) exposes two benchmark tools. Start the
server and send JSON-RPC 2.0 requests over stdio:

```bash
python -c "import qector_decoder_v3; qector_decoder_v3.run_mcp_server()"
```

**`benchmark_decoder`** runs the Rust-native throughput suite for one decoder family on
your check structure:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 1,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "benchmark_decoder",
    "arguments": {
      "check_to_qubits": [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3]],
      "n_qubits": 4,
      "n_samples": 10000,
      "seed": 42,
      "phys_error": 0.01,
      "decoder_type": "blossom"
    }
  }
}
```

Arguments:

| Argument | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `check_to_qubits` | required | check hyperedges of the code to benchmark |
| `n_qubits` | required | number of qubits |
| `n_samples` | `10000` | number of samples (bounded by server limit) |
| `seed` | `42` | determinism seed; keep it fixed for comparability |
| `phys_error` | `0.01` | physical error rate for syndrome generation |
| `decoder_type` | `blossom` | decoder family; strictly validated before any backend starts |

The result is the structured suite report (samples, elapsed, per-shot statistics) for
that decoder on that code. **License note**: this tool enforces an unlocked license
(`enforce_unlocked`); without a valid key it returns a license error, not a result.

**`run_ler_benchmark`** runs the logical-error-rate benchmark across multiple code
distances with no input arguments:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": { "name": "run_ler_benchmark", "arguments": {} }
}
```

It also requires an unlocked license. The result is the LER report across distances.

**Procedure** (do this in order):

1. Run `get_decoder_info` once to confirm server version and available families.
2. Run `get_backend_health` to know which tiers are actually available before
   benchmarking (e.g. CUDA tier only on a CUDA device; OpenCL always off in wheels).
3. Run `benchmark_decoder` with a fixed `seed` and `phys_error` for each family you
   compare; change only `decoder_type`.
4. Run `run_ler_benchmark` for the accuracy dimension.
5. Record everything from `get_server_env` (effective environment) plus your machine
   spec into the result log.
6. Clear the decoder cache (`clear_decoder_cache`) between families if you suspect
   cross-run state contamination.

## 5. Reporting checklist

When you publish or share any number produced with this package, attach:

- Package version (`qector-decoder-v3==1.0.0`), Python version, OS and platform.
- Machine: CPU model/microcode, RAM, GPU model and driver mode (WDDM/TCC).
- Power state (AC/battery, turbo, DVFS) and any other processes sharing the cores.
- Code: family, distance, rounds, check structure (or the code generator used).
- Noise: physical error probability and noise model; for LER, the result of
  `ler.assert_comparable` on all rows shown together.
- Seeds and shot counts; for throughput, the median of at least 3 runs.
- A sentence making explicit that figures are system-specific and not claimed as
  universal.

That is what "honest benchmarking" means with this package: same machine, same
sampling, same noise, same shot count, same seeds, everything labelled.
