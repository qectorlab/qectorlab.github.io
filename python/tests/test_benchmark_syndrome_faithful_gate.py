"""Section 9 (latency): the syndrome-faithfulness GATE.

``benchmark_decoder`` must report ``syndrome_faithful is True`` for every
CPU decoder kind across two code families. This is the correctness gate that
backs every reported latency/throughput number: if a benchmarked decode were
wrong, the benchmark is meaningless. No wall-clock thresholds.
