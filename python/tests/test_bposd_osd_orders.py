"""BP-OSD across OSD orders on the BB [[72,12]] code.

For osd_order in (0, 1, 2, 4) the decoder must remain syndrome-faithful, and a
higher OSD order must never produce a *heavier* correction than OSD-0 on the
same shot: OSD greedily improves on the order-0 pivot solution, so the Hamming
weight is monotonically non-increasing in the order.
