"""The correct LDPC logical-failure metric: stabiliser-rowspace membership of the residual.

Section 6 (logical-observable proof). For a CSS LDPC code decoded over ``Hx`` by BP-OSD,
the correct logical-failure criterion for the residual ``r = c ^ e`` is:

* ``r`` is *always* in ``ker(Hx)`` (BP-OSD is syndrome-faithful), and
* ``r`` is a *logical failure* iff it is NOT in the GF(2) row space of the Z-stabilisers
  ``Hz`` -- i.e. it is not a product of stabilisers.

The naive ``c != e`` metric over-counts, because a non-zero residual that lies in the
``Hz`` row space is a harmless stabiliser. We demonstrate that such residuals exist
(deterministically, by planting a stabiliser error), so the rowspace metric is required.

Code: bivariate-bicycle ``[[72, 12]]``.
