"""Section 9 (latency): benchmark_decoder reports the COLD path (decoder
construction time) separately from the HOT path (decode latency).

We assert ``cold_path_us`` is present, is a numeric summary dict with the same
summary keys as ``latency_us``, and is a distinct measurement (different sample
count and own values) -- proving construction cost is reported apart from the
steady-state decode cost. No wall-clock thresholds are asserted.
