"""Defect count vs excess matching weight: the gap does NOT grow with density.

A failing candidate-set heuristic shows up as the weight gap increasing with the
number of defects (denser syndromes => more chances to miss the optimal pairing).
This test builds the (defect_count, excess_weight) scatter and asserts there is no
meaningful positive correlation and the gap stays tiny across the whole defect
range - i.e. adaptive-k scales with defect count as intended.
