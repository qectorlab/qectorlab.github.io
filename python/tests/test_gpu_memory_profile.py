"""Section 8 (GPU proof): repeated CUDA batch decoding is stable and leak-free.

We run several repeated ``CUDABatchDecoder.batch_decode`` calls on a 16384-shot
batch at d=9 and assert:
  * every output is syndrome-faithful and bit-identical to the first call
    (deterministic, no silent drift across repeats); and
  * the process RSS (via psutil) does not grow unboundedly across the repeats.

The first call pays a one-time CUDA context / buffer initialisation cost, so the
growth check compares from the *second* call onward.

Requires psutil and a CUDA device; skipped otherwise.
