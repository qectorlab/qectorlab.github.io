"""Section 9 (latency): benchmark_decoder latency percentiles are order-statistic
monotonic for blossom / sparse_blossom / union_find on the rotated surface code.

We ONLY assert facts that hold by construction (p50<=p90<=p95<=p99, min<=p50<=max,
ci95_low<=mean<=ci95_high) plus syndrome-faithfulness. No wall-clock thresholds:
those would flake under machine load.

NOTE: ``rotated_surface_code`` takes a single ``distance`` argument in this build,
so the spec's "(5,7)" is realized as two distances, d=5 and d=7.
