"""Section 9 (latency): a small end-to-end performance smoke mirroring a
competitive-benchmark sweep.

Benchmark blossom + union_find + sparse_blossom at d in (3, 5), n_trials=400,
and assert the structural health of every result: syndrome-faithful, monotonic
percentiles, positive throughput, and a recorded peak Python allocation.
NO wall-clock thresholds -- only invariants that hold by construction.
