"""Scaling/benchmark example from docs/SCALING.md, executed for real.

docs/SCALING.md drives ``benchmark_decoder`` across a distance sweep and reads
``latency_us``, ``cold_path_us``, ``n_qubits`` etc. from the report. This test
runs that benchmark for rotated surface codes at d in (3, 5, 7) and asserts the
report's structural and order-statistic invariants:

* latency percentiles are monotone (p50 <= p90 <= p95 <= p99) by construction,
* ``cold_path_us`` (construction cost) is present,
* the run is syndrome-faithful, and
* ``n_qubits`` grows with distance (d^2 for the rotated surface code).

Only order-statistic and faithfulness facts are asserted - never wall-clock
thresholds - so the test does not flake under machine load.
