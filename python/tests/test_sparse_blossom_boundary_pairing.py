"""SparseBlossom boundary pairing on the repetition code.

The repetition code has an open boundary: a lone defect is corrected by pairing
it to the nearest boundary, and a pair of defects is corrected by pairing them to
each other when that is cheaper than two boundary paths.  We verify SparseBlossom
returns syndrome-faithful corrections and compare its Hamming weight to the exact
MWPM weight (``BlossomDecoder``) for:

* every single isolated defect (one check lit), including the two near the
  boundary - here SparseBlossom is exactly optimal (weight equals exact MWPM),
  and the boundary defects have minimal weight 1; and
* every defect pair - here SparseBlossom is near-optimal: never lighter than
  exact, almost always equal, occasionally heavier by a small bounded amount
  when region growing pairs a defect to the boundary instead of to its partner.
