"""Version consistency across the packaging surfaces.

The single source-of-truth version must be identical in three places:

* ``pyproject.toml`` ``[project] version`` (the wheel/sdist metadata),
* ``Cargo.toml`` ``[package] version`` (the Rust crate that compiles the
  extension), and
* ``qector_decoder_v3.__version__`` (what users actually see at runtime).

A drift between any of these ships a wheel whose advertised version does not
match the compiled core, so this test fails loudly if they disagree.
